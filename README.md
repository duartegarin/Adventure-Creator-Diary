# Overview
This collection of scripts provides a Diary capability to a game running Unity and Adventure Creator.

Note: This is not yet usable as I need to sort out dependencies from within my own project (The Seven Tides)

# Dependencies
For this to work you will need:

1. Unity
2. Adventure Creator

# Getting started
This is still not usable outside of my own project.
